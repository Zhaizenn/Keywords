These are reserved for special purpose and must
not be used as normal identifier names.

Keywords are the reserved words in Python.
We cannot use a keyword as a variable name,
function name or any other identifier.

They are used to define the syntax and structure
of the Python language.

In Python, keywords are case sensitive.

All the keywords except True, False and None are
in lowercase and they must be written as they
are.
